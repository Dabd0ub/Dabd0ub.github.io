I’m a Computer Engineering with a strong passion for Cybersecurity, specializing in web, mobile, and network penetration testing.  
With hands-on experience in offensive security, I actively work as a part-time **Bug Bounty Hunter**, where I’ve been recognized in the **Hall of Fame** by organizations such as:

- **Autodesk**  
- **Daimler Truck**  
- **Zurich Insurance**

I hold the **eWPTX** certification, which has helped me develop deep technical skills in advanced web exploitation and real-world attack simulation.
